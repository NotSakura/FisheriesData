# Analysing the Number of Fish Caught in the North Pacific Ocean

## Overview
We analyzed data on fish catches in the North Pacific Ocean using Bayesian modeling. Our analysis shows that the number of fish caught has increased over time. This suggests that fishing activities in the region have intensified. Understanding this trend is important for managing fish populations and ensuring the sustainability of the ocean's resources. This is important as the Pacific is full of different kind of fish like, tuna and salmon that are essential in the food chain, but are being overhunted for food and recreational purposes.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from NPAFC.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed. contains parquet too
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT. It was used to help with anything from finding inspiration for budget allocation, to graphing, to making correct citations. [https://chatgpt.com/share/67454985-35b0-8012-8766-98c2cf4ff319
